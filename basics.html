learning from data; they can enhance themselves by learning new&nbsp;heuristics&nbsp;(strategies,
or "rules of thumb", that have worked well in the past), or can
themselves write other algorithms. Some of the "learners" described
below, including Bayesian networks, decision trees, and nearest-neighbor, could
theoretically, (given infinite data, time, and memory) learn to approximate
any&nbsp;function, including which combination of mathematical functions would
best describe the world. These learners could therefore derive all possible
knowledge, by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against
the data. In practice, it is seldom possible to consider every possibility,
because of the phenomenon of "combinatorial explosion", where the
time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially. Much of AI research
involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of
possibilities unlikely to be beneficial.&nbsp;For example, when viewing a map
and looking for the shortest driving route from&nbsp;Denver&nbsp;to&nbsp;New York&nbsp;in
the East, one can in most cases skip looking at any path through&nbsp;San
Francisco&nbsp;or other areas far to the West; thus, an AI wielding a
pathfinding algorithm like&nbsp;A*&nbsp;can avoid the combinatorial explosion
that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; background-color: white;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">The earliest (and easiest to understand)
approach to AI was symbolism (such as formal logic): "If an otherwise
healthy adult has a fever, then they may have&nbsp;influenza". A second,
more general, approach is&nbsp;Bayesian inference: "If the current patient
has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such
way". The third major approach, extremely popular in routine business AI
applications, are analogizers such as&nbsp;SVM&nbsp;and&nbsp;nearest-neighbor:
"After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature,
symptoms</span><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(32, 33, 34);">,</span> <span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">age, and other factors
mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have
influenza". A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand, but is
inspired by how the brain's machinery works: the&nbsp;artificial neural network&nbsp;approach
uses artificial "neurons" that can learn by comparing itself to the
desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its
internal neurons to "reinforce" connections that seemed to be useful.
These four main approaches can overlap with each other and with evolutionary
systems; for example, neural nets can learn to make inferences, to generalize,
and to make analogies. Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of
these approaches, alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms; the best
approach is often different depending on the problem.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; background-color: white;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">Learning algorithms work on the basis
that strategies, algorithms, and inferences that worked well in the past are
likely to continue working well in the future. These inferences can be obvious,
such as "since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days, it
will probably rise tomorrow morning as well". They can be nuanced, such as
"X% of&nbsp;families&nbsp;have geographically separate species with color
variants, so there is a Y% chance that undiscovered&nbsp;black swans&nbsp;exist".
Learners also work on the basis of "Occam's razor": The simplest
theory that explains the data is the likeliest. Therefore, according to Occam's
razor principle, a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler
theories to complex theories, except in cases where the complex theory is
proven substantially better.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; background-color: white;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">Settling on a bad, overly complex theory
gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as&nbsp;overfitting.
Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance
with how well it fits the data, but penalizing the theory in accordance with
how complex the theory is.&nbsp;Besides classic overfitting, learners can also
disappoint by "learning the wrong lesson". A toy example is that an
image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude
that all brown patches are likely to be horses.&nbsp;A real-world example is
that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often don't primarily make
judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and
they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that
still correlate with images of certain types of real objects. Modifying these
patterns on a legitimate image can result in "adversarial" images
that the system misclassifies.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 6pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 6pt; margin-left: 0in; background-color: white;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">Compared with humans, existing AI lacks
several features of human "commonsense reasoning"; most notably,
humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about "naïve physics"
such as space, time, and physical interactions. This enables even young
children to easily make inferences like "If I roll this pen off a table,
it will fall on the floor". Humans also have a powerful mechanism of
"folk psychology" that helps them to interpret natural-language
sentences such as "The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit
because they advocated violence" (A generic AI has difficulty discerning
whether</span> <span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(32, 33, 34);">the ones alleged to be
advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators). This lack of
"common knowledge" means that AI often makes different mistakes than
humans make, in ways that can seem incomprehensible. For example, existing
self-driving cars cannot reason about the location nor the intentions of
pedestrians in the exact way that humans do, and instead must use non-human
modes of reasoning to avoid accidents.</span></p></div>
