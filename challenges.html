architectures are very limited, using only a simplified version of what
intelligence is really capable of. For instance, the human mind has come up
with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different
occurrences in life. What would have been otherwise straightforward, an
equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as
opposed to using the human mind. This gives rise to two classes of models:
structuralist and functionalist. The structural models aim to loosely mimic the
basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic. The
functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart.</span></p>

intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to
function in an intelligent manner. The general problem of simulating (or
creating) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems. These consist of
particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system
to display. The traits described below have received the most attention.</span></p>

that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or
make logical deductions.&nbsp;By the late 1980s and 1990s, AI research had
developed methods for dealing with&nbsp;uncertain&nbsp;or incomplete
information, employing concepts from&nbsp;probability&nbsp;and&nbsp;economics.</span></p>

insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a
"combinatorial explosion": they became exponentially slower as the
problems grew larger.&nbsp;Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction
that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using
fast, intuitive judgments.</span></p>

engineering&nbsp;are central to classical AI research. Some "expert
systems" attempt to gather explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some
narrow domain. In addition, some projects attempt to gather the
"commonsense knowledge" known to the average person into a database
containing extensive knowledge about the world. Among the things a
comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are: objects,
properties, categories and relations between objects; situations, events,
states and time; causes and effects;&nbsp;knowledge about knowledge (what we
know about what other people know);&nbsp;and many other, less well researched
domains. A representation of "what exists" is an&nbsp;ontology: the
set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties formally described so that
software agents can interpret them. The&nbsp;semantics&nbsp;of these are
captured as&nbsp;description logic&nbsp;concepts, roles, and individuals, and
typically implemented as classes, properties, and individuals in the&nbsp;Web
Ontology Language.&nbsp;The most general ontologies are called&nbsp;upper
ontologies, which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge</span><sup> </sup><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">by acting as mediators
between&nbsp;domain ontologies&nbsp;that cover specific knowledge about a
particular knowledge domain (field of interest or area of concern). Such formal
knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval,&nbsp;scene
interpretation,&nbsp;clinical decision support,&nbsp;knowledge discovery
(mining "interesting" and actionable inferences from large
databases),&nbsp;and other areas.</span></p>

form of "working assumptions". For example, if a bird comes up in
conversation, people typically picture a fist-sized animal that sings and
flies. None of these things are true about all birds.&nbsp;John McCarthy&nbsp;identified
this problem in 1969&nbsp;as the qualification problem: for any commonsense
rule that AI researchers care to represent, there tend to be a huge number of
exceptions. Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract
logic requires. AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.2pt; margin-left: 0.5in; background-color: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">Breadth of commonsense

average person knows is very large. Research projects that attempt to build a
complete knowledge base of&nbsp;commonsense knowledge&nbsp;(e.g.,&nbsp;Cyc)
require enormous amounts of laborious&nbsp;ontological engineering—they must be
built, by hand, one complicated concept at a times.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.2pt; margin-left: 0.5in; background-color: white;"><b><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">Subsymbolic form of

represented as "facts" or "statements" that they could
express verbally. For example, a chess master will avoid a particular chess
position because it "feels too exposed"&nbsp;or an art critic can
take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake.&nbsp;These are
non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain.&nbsp;Knowledge
like this informs, supports and provides a context for symbolic, conscious knowledge.
As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning, it is hoped that&nbsp;situated
AI,&nbsp;computational intelligence, or&nbsp;statistical AI&nbsp;will provide
ways to represent this knowledge.</span></p>

can assume that it is the only system acting in the world, allowing the agent
to be certain of the consequences of its actions.&nbsp;However, if the agent is
not the only actor, then it requires that the agent can reason under
uncertainty. This calls for an agent that can not only assess its environment
and make predictions but also evaluate its predictions and adapt based on its
assessment.</span></p>

to find patterns in a stream of input, without requiring a human to label the
inputs first.&nbsp;Supervised learning&nbsp;includes both&nbsp;classification&nbsp;and
numerical&nbsp;regression, which requires a human to label the input data
first. Classification is used to determine what category something belongs in,
and occurs after a program sees a number of examples of things from several
categories. Regression is the attempt to produce a function that describes the
relationship between inputs and outputs and predicts how the outputs should
change as the inputs change.&nbsp;Both classifiers and regression learners can
be viewed as "function approximators" trying to learn an unknown
(possibly implicit) function; for example, a spam classifier can be viewed as
learning a function that maps from the text of an email to one of two
categories, "spam" or "not spam".&nbsp;Computational learning
theory&nbsp;can assess learners by&nbsp;computational complexity, by&nbsp;sample
complexity&nbsp;(how much data is required), or by other notions of&nbsp;optimization.&nbsp;In&nbsp;reinforcement
learning&nbsp;the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad
ones. The agent uses this sequence of rewards and punishments to form a
strategy for operating in its problem space.</span></p>

allows machines to read and&nbsp;understand&nbsp;human language. A sufficiently
powerful natural language processing system would enable&nbsp;natural-language
user interfaces&nbsp;and the acquisition of knowledge directly from
human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Some straightforward applications
of natural language processing include&nbsp;information retrieval,&nbsp;text
mining,&nbsp;question answering&nbsp;and&nbsp;machine translation.&nbsp;Many
current approaches use word co-occurrence frequencies to construct syntactic
representations of text. "Keyword spotting" strategies for search are
popular and scalable but dumb; a search query for "dog" might only
match documents with the literal word "dog" and miss a document with
the word "poodle". "Lexical affinity" strategies use the
occurrence of words such as "accident" to&nbsp;assess the sentiment&nbsp;of
a document. Modern statistical NLP approaches can combine all these strategies
as well as others, and often achieve acceptable accuracy at the page or
paragraph level. Beyond semantic NLP, the ultimate goal of
"narrative" NLP is to embody a full understanding of commonsense
reasoning. By 2019,&nbsp;transformer-based deep learning architectures could
generate coherent text.</span></p>

sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Applications include&nbsp;speech
recognition,&nbsp;facial recognition, and&nbsp;object recognition.&nbsp;Computer
vision&nbsp;is the ability to analyze visual input. Such input is usually
ambiguous; a giant, fifty-meter-tall pedestrian far away may produce the same
pixels as a nearby normal-sized pedestrian, requiring the AI to judge the
relative likelihood and reasonableness of different interpretations, for
example by using its "object model" to assess that fifty-meter
pedestrians do not exist.</span></p>

arms&nbsp;and other&nbsp;industrial robots, widely used in modern factories,
can learn from experience how to move efficiently despite the presence of
friction and gear slippage.&nbsp;A modern mobile robot, when given a small,
static, and visible environment, can easily determine its location and&nbsp;map&nbsp;its
environment; however, dynamic environments, such as (in&nbsp;endoscopy) the
interior of a patient's breathing body, pose a greater challenge.&nbsp;Motion
planning&nbsp;is the process of breaking down a movement task into
"primitives" such as individual joint movements. Such movement often
involves compliant motion, a process where movement requires maintaining
physical contact with an object.&nbsp;Moravec's paradox&nbsp;generalizes that
low-level sensorimotor skills that humans take for granted are,
counterintuitively, difficult to program into a robot; the paradox is named
after&nbsp;Hans Moravec, who stated in 1988 that "it is comparatively easy
to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or
playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a
one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility". This is attributed
to the fact that, unlike checkers, physical dexterity has been a direct target
of&nbsp;natural selection&nbsp;for millions of years.</span></p>

forms of social intelligence.&nbsp;Distributed multi-agent coordination of
autonomous vehicles remains a difficult problem.&nbsp;Affective computing&nbsp;is
an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems which recognize,
interpret, process, or simulate human&nbsp;affects. Moderate successes related
to affective computing include textual&nbsp;sentiment analysis&nbsp;and, more
recently, multimodal affect analysis (see&nbsp;multimodal sentiment analysis),
wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.</span></p>

understanding of human emotion and&nbsp;game theory&nbsp;would be valuable to a
social agent. The ability to predict the actions of others by understanding
their motives and emotional states would allow an agent to make better
decisions. Some computer systems mimic human emotion and expressions to appear
more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise
facilitate&nbsp;human–computer interaction. Similarly, some&nbsp;virtual
assistants&nbsp;are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter
humorously; this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of how
intelligent existing computer agents actually are.</span></p>

knowledge base (1984) and the massive Japanese&nbsp;Fifth Generation Computer
Systems&nbsp;initiative (1982–1992) attempted to cover the breadth of human
cognition. These early projects failed to escape the limitations of
non-quantitative symbolic logic models and, in retrospect, greatly
underestimated the difficulty of cross-domain AI. Nowadays, most current AI
researchers work instead on tractable "narrow AI" applications (such
as medical diagnosis or automobile navigation).&nbsp;Many researchers predict
that such "narrow AI" work in different individual domains will
eventually be incorporated into a machine with&nbsp;artificial general
intelligence&nbsp;(AGI), combining most of the narrow skills mentioned in this
article and at some point even exceeding human ability in most or all these
areas.&nbsp;Many advances have general, cross-domain significance. One
high-profile example is that&nbsp;DeepMind&nbsp;in the 2010s developed a
"generalized artificial intelligence" that could learn many
diverse&nbsp;Atari&nbsp;games on its own, and later developed a variant of the
system which succeeds at&nbsp;sequential learning.&nbsp;Besides&nbsp;transfer
learning,&nbsp;hypothetical AGI breakthroughs could include the development of
reflective architectures that can engage in decision-theoretic metareasoning,
and figuring out how to "slurp up" a comprehensive knowledge base
from the entire unstructured&nbsp;Web.&nbsp;Some argue that some kind of
(currently-undiscovered) conceptually straightforward, but mathematically
difficult, "Master Algorithm" could lead to AGI. Finally, a few
"emergent" approaches look to simulating human intelligence extremely
closely, and believe that&nbsp;anthropomorphic&nbsp;features like an&nbsp;artificial
brain&nbsp;or simulated&nbsp;child development&nbsp;may someday reach a
critical point where general intelligence emerges.</span></p>

translation, require that a machine read and write in both languages (NLP),
follow the author's argument (reason), know what is being talked about (knowledge),
and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent (social intelligence). A
problem like machine translation is considered "AI-complete", because
all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach
human-level machine performance.</span></p><p><br></p></div>
