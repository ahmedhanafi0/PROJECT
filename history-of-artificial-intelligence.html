         devices&nbsp;in antiquity, and have been common in fiction, as in&nbsp;Mary
         Shelley's&nbsp;<i><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">Frankenstein</span></i>&nbsp;or&nbsp;Karel Čapek's&nbsp;<i><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">R.U.R.</span></i>&nbsp;These
         characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the&nbsp;ethics
         of artificial intelligence.</span><br></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">The study of mechanical or&nbsp;"formal" reasoning&nbsp;began
         with&nbsp;philosophers&nbsp;and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of
         mathematical logic led directly to&nbsp;Alan Turing's&nbsp;theory of
         computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as
         "0" and "1", could simulate any conceivable act of
         mathematical deduction. This insight, that digital computers can simulate any
         process of formal reasoning, is known as the&nbsp;Church–Turing thesis.&nbsp;Along
         with concurrent discoveries in&nbsp;neurobiology,&nbsp;information theory&nbsp;and&nbsp;cybernetics,
         this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic
         brain. Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was
         intelligent, to "whether or not it is possible for machinery to show
         intelligent behaviour.The first work that is now generally recognized as AI
         was&nbsp;McCullouch&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pitts' 1943 formal design for&nbsp;Turing-complete&nbsp;"artificial
         neurons".</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">The field of AI research was born at&nbsp;a workshop&nbsp;at&nbsp;Dartmouth
         College&nbsp;in 1956,&nbsp;where the term "Artificial Intelligence"
         was coined by&nbsp;John McCarthy&nbsp;to distinguish the field from cybernetics
         and escape the influence of the cyberneticist&nbsp;Norbert Wiener.&nbsp;Attendees&nbsp;Allen
         Newell&nbsp;(CMU),&nbsp;Herbert Simon&nbsp;(CMU), John McCarthy (MIT),&nbsp;Marvin
         Minsky&nbsp;(MIT) and&nbsp;Arthur Samuel&nbsp;(IBM) became the founders and
         leaders of AI research.&nbsp;They and their students produced programs that the
         press described as "astonishing":&nbsp;computers were learning&nbsp;checkers&nbsp;strategies
         (c. 1954)&nbsp;(and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average
         human), solving word problems in algebra, proving&nbsp;logical theorems&nbsp;(Logic
         Theorist, first run c. 1956) and speaking English.&nbsp;By the middle of the
         1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the&nbsp;Department of
         Defense&nbsp;and laboratories had been established around the world.&nbsp;AI's
         founders were optimistic about the future:&nbsp;Herbert Simon&nbsp;predicted,
         "machines will be capable, within twenty years of doing any work a man can
         do".&nbsp;Marvin Minsky&nbsp;agreed, writing, "within a
         generation&nbsp;... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will
         substantially be solved".</span></p><p>
         
        </p><p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining
         tasks. Progress slowed and in 1974, in response to the criticism of&nbsp;Sir
         James Lighthill</span><sup> </sup><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more
         productive projects, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory
         research in AI. The next few years would later be called an "AI winter",a
         period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult.</span></span></p><p>
         
        </p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial
         success of&nbsp;expert systems,&nbsp;a form of AI program that simulated the
         knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI
         had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's&nbsp;fifth
         generation computer&nbsp;project inspired the U.S and British governments to
         restore funding for&nbsp;academic research. &nbsp;However, beginning with the
         collapse of the&nbsp;Lisp Machine&nbsp;market in 1987, AI once again fell into
         disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting hiatus began.</span></p><p>

         integration&nbsp;(VLSI), in the form of&nbsp;complementary MOS&nbsp;(CMOS)&nbsp;transistor&nbsp;technology,
         enabled the development of practical&nbsp;artificial neural network&nbsp;(ANN)
         technology in the 1980s. A landmark publication in the field was the 1989
         book&nbsp;<i><span style="background-color: #FFFFFF;">Analog VLSI Implementation of Neural Systems</span></i>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Carver
         A. Mead&nbsp;and Mohammed Ismail.</span></p><p>
         
        </p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI began to be used
         for logistics,&nbsp;data mining,&nbsp;medical diagnosis&nbsp;and other areas.&nbsp;The
         success was due to increasing computational power (see&nbsp;Moore's law&nbsp;and&nbsp;transistor
         count), greater emphasis on solving specific problems, new ties between AI and
         other fields (such as&nbsp;statistics,&nbsp;economics&nbsp;and&nbsp;mathematics),
         and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific
         standards.&nbsp;Deep Blue&nbsp;became the first computer chess-playing system
         to beat a reigning world chess champion,&nbsp;Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.</span></p><p>

         2016,&nbsp;AlphaGo&nbsp;won 4 out of 5 games of&nbsp;Go&nbsp;in a match with Go
         champion&nbsp;Lee Sedol, becoming the first&nbsp;computer Go-playing system to
         beat a professional Go player without&nbsp;handicaps. In the 2017&nbsp;Future
         of Go Summit,&nbsp;AlphaGo&nbsp;won a&nbsp;three-game match&nbsp;with&nbsp;Ke
         Jie,&nbsp;who at the time continuously held the world No. 1 ranking for two
         years.&nbsp;Deep Blue's&nbsp;Murray Campbell&nbsp;called AlphaGo's victory
         "the end of an era... board games are more or less done&nbsp;and it's time
         to move on."&nbsp;This marked the completion of a significant milestone in
         the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is a relatively complex game,
         more so than Chess. AlphaGo was later improved, generalized to other games like
         chess, with&nbsp;Alpha Zero; and&nbsp;MuZero&nbsp;to play many different&nbsp;video
         games, that were previously handled separately,&nbsp;in addition to board
         games. Other programs handle&nbsp;imperfect-information&nbsp;games, such as
         for&nbsp;poker&nbsp;at a superhuman level,&nbsp;Pluribus (poker bot)&nbsp;and&nbsp;Cepheus
         (poker bot).&nbsp;See:&nbsp;General game playing.</span></span></p><p>

         landmark year for artificial intelligence, with the number of software projects
         that use AI within&nbsp;Google&nbsp;increased from a "sporadic usage"
         in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects. Clark also presents factual data
         indicating the improvements of AI since 2012 supported by lower error rates in
         image processing tasks.</span><sup id="cite_ref-:0_70-0"> </sup><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;He attributes this to an
         increase in affordable&nbsp;neural networks, due to a rise in cloud computing
         infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets. Other cited
         examples include Microsoft's development of a Skype system that can
         automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook's system that
         can describe images to blind people. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies
         reported they had "incorporated AI in some offerings or processes".&nbsp;Around
         2016,&nbsp;China&nbsp;greatly accelerated its government funding; given its
         large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output, some observers
         believe it may be on track to becoming an "AI superpower.</span></span></p><p>
         
        </p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 18px;">By 2020,&nbsp;Natural Language Processing&nbsp;systems such as
         the enormous&nbsp;GPT-3&nbsp;(then by far the largest artificial neural
         network) were matching human performance on pre-existing benchmarks, albeit
         without the system attaining commonsense understanding of the contents of the
         benchmarks.&nbsp;DeepMind's&nbsp;Alpha Fold 2&nbsp;(2020) demonstrated the
         ability to determine, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a
         protein. Facial recognition advanced to where, under some circumstances, some
         systems claim to have a 99% accuracy rate.</span></p>
