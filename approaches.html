AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues.&nbsp;A few of the most
long-standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should
artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying&nbsp;psychology&nbsp;or&nbsp;neurobiology?
Or is&nbsp;human biology&nbsp;as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is
to&nbsp;aeronautical engineering?&nbsp;Can intelligent behavior be described
using simple, elegant principles (such as&nbsp;logic&nbsp;or&nbsp;optimization)?
Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of unrelated problems?</span></p>

researchers explored the connection between&nbsp;neurobiology,&nbsp;information
theory, and&nbsp;cybernetics. Some of them built machines that used electronic
networks to exhibit rudimentary intelligence, such as&nbsp;W. Grey Walter's&nbsp;turtles&nbsp;and
the&nbsp;Johns Hopkins Beast. Many of these researchers gathered for meetings
of the Teleological Society at&nbsp;Princeton University&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Ratio
Club&nbsp;in England.&nbsp;By 1960, this approach was largely abandoned,
although elements of it would be revived in the 1980s.</span></p>

possible in the mid-1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that
human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation. The research was
centered in three institutions:&nbsp;Carnegie Mellon University,&nbsp;Stanford,
and&nbsp;MIT, and as described below, each one developed its own style of
research.&nbsp;John Haugeland&nbsp;named these symbolic approaches to AI
"good old fashioned AI" or "GOFAI".&nbsp;During the 1960s,
symbolic approaches had achieved great success at simulating high-level
"thinking" in small demonstration programs. Approaches based on&nbsp;cybernetics&nbsp;or&nbsp;artificial
neural networks&nbsp;were abandoned or pushed into the background.&nbsp;Researchers
in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that symbolic approaches would
eventually succeed in creating a machine with&nbsp;artificial general
intelligence&nbsp;and considered this the goal of their field.</span></p>

attempted to formalize them, and their work laid the foundations of the field
of artificial intelligence, as well as&nbsp;cognitive science,&nbsp;operations
research&nbsp;and&nbsp;management science. Their research team used the results
of&nbsp;psychological&nbsp;experiments to develop programs that simulated the
techniques that people used to solve problems. This tradition, centered
at&nbsp;Carnegie Mellon University&nbsp;would eventually culminate in the
development of the&nbsp;Soar&nbsp;architecture in the middle 1980s.</span></p>

McCarthy&nbsp;felt that machines did not need to simulate human thought, but
should instead try to find the essence of abstract reasoning and
problem-solving, regardless of whether people used the same algorithms.&nbsp;His
laboratory at&nbsp;Stanford&nbsp;(SAIL) focused on using formal&nbsp;logic&nbsp;to
solve a wide variety of problems, including&nbsp;knowledge representation,&nbsp;planning&nbsp;and&nbsp;learning.&nbsp;Logic
was also the focus of the work at the&nbsp;University of Edinburgh&nbsp;and
elsewhere in Europe which led to the development of the programming
language&nbsp;Prolog&nbsp;and the science of&nbsp;logic programming.</span></p>

as&nbsp;Marvin Minsky&nbsp;and&nbsp;Seymour Papert)&nbsp;found that solving
difficult problems in&nbsp;vision&nbsp;and&nbsp;natural language processing&nbsp;required
ad hoc solutionsâ€”they argued that no simple and general principle (like&nbsp;logic)
would capture all the aspects of intelligent behavior.&nbsp;Roger Schank&nbsp;described
their "anti-logic" approaches as "scruffy" (as opposed to
the "neat" paradigms at&nbsp;CMU&nbsp;and Stanford).&nbsp;Commonsense
knowledge bases&nbsp;(such as&nbsp;Doug Lenat's&nbsp;Cyc) are an example of
"scruffy" AI, since they must be built by hand, one complicated
concept at a time.</span></p>

available around 1970, researchers from all three traditions began to
build&nbsp;knowledge&nbsp;into AI applications. This "knowledge
revolution" led to the development and deployment of&nbsp;expert systems&nbsp;(introduced
by&nbsp;Edward Feigenbaum), the first truly successful form of AI software. A
key component of the system architecture for all expert systems is the
knowledge base, which stores facts and rules that illustrate AI.&nbsp;The
knowledge revolution was also driven by the realization that enormous amounts
of knowledge would be required by many simple AI applications.</span></p>

seemed to stall and many believed that symbolic systems would never be able to imitate
all the processes of human cognition, especially&nbsp;perception,
robotics,&nbsp;learning&nbsp;and&nbsp;pattern recognition. A number of
researchers began to look into "sub-symbolic" approaches to specific
AI problems.&nbsp;Sub-symbolic methods manage to approach intelligence without
specific representations of knowledge.</span></p>

such as&nbsp;Rodney Brooks, rejected symbolic AI and focused on the basic
engineering problems that would allow robots to move and survive.&nbsp;Their
work revived the non-symbolic point of view of the early&nbsp;cybernetics&nbsp;researchers
of the 1950s and reintroduced the use of&nbsp;control theory&nbsp;in AI. This
coincided with the development of the&nbsp;embodied mind thesis&nbsp;in the
related field of&nbsp;cognitive science: the idea that aspects of the body
(such as movement, perception and visualization) are required for higher
intelligence.</span></p>

learning approaches are elaborated upon to allow robots to accumulate
repertoires of novel skills through autonomous self-exploration, social
interaction with human teachers, and the use of guidance mechanisms (active
learning, maturation, motor synergies, etc.).</span></p>

"connectionism" was revived by&nbsp;David Rumelhart&nbsp;and others
in the middle of the 1980s.&nbsp;Artificial neural networks&nbsp;are an example
of&nbsp;soft computingâ€”they are solutions to problems which cannot be solved
with complete logical certainty, and where an approximate solution is often
sufficient. Other&nbsp;soft computing&nbsp;approaches to AI include&nbsp;fuzzy
systems,&nbsp;Grey system theory,&nbsp;evolutionary computation&nbsp;and many
statistical tools. The application of soft computing to AI is studied
collectively by the emerging discipline of&nbsp;computational intelligence.</span></p>

bogged down on&nbsp;<i>ad hoc</i>&nbsp;patches to&nbsp;symbolic computation&nbsp;that
worked on their own toy models but failed to generalize to real-world results.
However, around the 1990s, AI researchers adopted sophisticated mathematical
tools, such as&nbsp;hidden Markov models&nbsp;(HMM),&nbsp;information theory,
and normative Bayesian&nbsp;decision theory&nbsp;to compare or to unify
competing architectures. The shared mathematical language permitted a high
level of collaboration with more established fields (like&nbsp;mathematics,
economics or&nbsp;operations research).&nbsp;Compared with GOFAI, new
"statistical learning" techniques such as HMM and neural networks
were gaining higher levels of accuracy in many practical domains such as&nbsp;data
mining, without necessarily acquiring a semantic understanding of the datasets.
The increased successes with real-world data led to increasing emphasis on
comparing different approaches against shared test data to see which approach
performed best in a broader context than that provided by idiosyncratic toy
models; AI research was becoming more&nbsp;scientific. Nowadays results of
experiments are often rigorously measurable, and are sometimes (with
difficulty) reproducible.&nbsp;Different statistical learning techniques have
different limitations; for example, basic HMM cannot model the infinite
possible combinations of natural language. Critics note that the shift from
GOFAI to statistical learning is often also a shift away from&nbsp;explainable
AI. In AGI research, some scholars caution against over-reliance on statistical
learning, and argue that continuing research into GOFAI will still be necessary
to attain general intelligence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 1.2pt; margin-left: 0.5in; background-color: white;"><span style="font-size: 13pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: black;">An&nbsp;intelligent agent&nbsp;is a
system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its
chances of success. The simplest intelligent agents are programs that solve
specific problems. More complicated agents include human beings and
organizations of human beings (such as&nbsp;firms). The paradigm allows
researchers to directly compare or even combine different approaches to
isolated problems, by asking which agent is best at maximizing a given
"goal function". An agent that solves a specific problem can use any
approach that worksâ€”some agents are symbolic and logical, some are
sub-symbolic&nbsp;artificial neural networks&nbsp;and others may use new
approaches. The paradigm also gives researchers a common language to
communicate with other fieldsâ€”such as&nbsp;decision theory&nbsp;and
economicsâ€”that also use concepts of abstract agents. Building a complete agent
requires researchers to address realistic problems of integration; for example,
because sensory systems give uncertain information about the environment,
planning systems must be able to function in the presence of uncertainty. The
intelligent agent paradigm became widely accepted during the 1990s.</span></p>

build intelligent systems out of interacting&nbsp;intelligent agents&nbsp;in
a&nbsp;multi-agent system.&nbsp;A&nbsp;hierarchical control system&nbsp;provides
a bridge between sub-symbolic AI at its lowest, reactive levels and traditional
symbolic AI at its highest levels, where relaxed time constraints permit
planning and world modeling.&nbsp;Some cognitive architectures are custom-built
to solve a narrow problem; others, such as&nbsp;Soar, are designed to mimic
human cognition and to provide insight into general intelligence. Modern
extensions of Soar are&nbsp;hybrid intelligent systems&nbsp;that include both
symbolic and sub-symbolic components.</span></p><p><br></p></div>
